Simple Portal modification for SMF

SimplePortal is one of several portal mods for Simple Machines Forum (SMF). Although always developing, SimplePortal is produced with the user in mind first. User feedback is the number one method of growth for SimplePortal, and our users are always finding ways for SimplePortal to grow. SimplePortal stays competative with other portal software by adding numerous user-requested features such as articles, block types and the ability to completely customize the portal page.

All this and SimplePortal has remained Simple! SimplePortal is built for simplicity and ease of use; ensuring the average forum administrator can install SimplePortal, configure a few settings, and show off the brand new portal to the users in minutes. Confusing menus, undesired pre-loaded blocks and settings that cannot be found are all avoided as much as possible. Because when it comes down to it, SimplePortal is YOUR portal, and should reflect your taste as much as possible.

Ultimate Simplicity
The simplest portal you can ever think of... You only need a few clicks to install it through Package Manager. A few more to create your own blocks and articles. Your portal is ready to go within a couple of minutes, and simple to customise to reflect YOU.
